  Introduce: `
<div>This product began with a real creative roadblock.</div>
<br />
<div>Years ago, I wanted to create a video project themed around the Long March. But once I entered production, I found existing tools painfully fragmented—editing, animation, and 2D/3D workflows were all disconnected. My creativity was constantly interrupted by the process. That was when I realized: creativity hadn’t become harder—the tools had simply fallen behind expression.</div>
<br />
<div>In June last year, I resigned with only 50,000 RMB in savings and started this journey alone. Over 18 months, I rebuilt this online creation platform from the ground up. It’s not just a “web-based editing tool,” but a completely reimagined system centered on real-time rendering, component-based motion design, 2D/3D integration, and cloud creation.</div>
<br />
<div>This is a tool built for long-term creators. It doesn’t chase trends—only the freedom and efficiency of expression.</div>
<br />
<div>If you’ve ever felt your creativity limited by tools, you’re welcome to join us and push the boundaries of creation a little further together.</div>
